## Tutorials for Building Virtual DOM Apps
This [learning path](https://docs.oracle.com/en/middleware/developer-tools/jet/19/vdom-tutorials.html) teaches developers how to build Oracle JET apps using virtual DOM architecture. This was a collaborative project, though I independently planned and created all tutorial content for the modules Compose Components, Responsive Design, and Master Detail Views in Oracle JET.

### Responsive Design

#### [Add Containers to the Oracle JET Virtual DOM App](https://apexapps.oracle.com/pls/apex/f?p=44785:112:0::::P112_CONTENT_ID:32346)
This first tutorial in the module teaches developers how to add Oracle JET flex layout style classes to their app to make their page layout responsive to screen-size changes.

#### [Show or Hide Content in the Oracle JET Virtual DOM App](https://apexapps.oracle.com/pls/apex/f?p=44785:112:0::::P112_CONTENT_ID:32348)
The third tutorial teaches developers how to monitor changes in the size of the window that their app is running in and modify their app’s components to load different content to adjust to changes in screen size.

### Master Detail Views in Oracle JET

#### [Create the Master View in an Oracle JET Virtual DOM App](https://apexapps.oracle.com/pls/apex/f?p=44785:112:0::::P112_CONTENT_ID:32350)
This first tutorial in the module teaches developers how to read data from a local JSON document and use an Oracle JET data-provider object to display the data in a list.

#### [Handle Selection Events in an Oracle JET Virtual DOM App](https://apexapps.oracle.com/pls/apex/f?p=44785:112:0::::P112_CONTENT_ID:32352)
This tutorial concludes this module and instructs developers on how to use change listeners and event handlers to modify their app’s displayed master-detail data to respond to Oracle JET List View component selection events.
