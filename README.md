# Technical Writing Portfolio

This repository is a collection of my technical writing samples. I've included a range of document types that demonstrate my ability to break down complex technologies, concepts, and procedures into accessible and useful content.

- For my general writing samples, including developer-guide topics, reference documentation, and release notes, see [developer-guide-samples.md](/JKWilkerson/technical-writing-portfolio/developer-guide-samples.md).
- For my tutorial samples, see [tutorials.md](/JKWilkerson/technical-writing-portfolio/tutorials.md).
